## Problem 

One third of the food produced in the world gets lost or wasted contributing to climate change â€” whereas there are shelter homes deprived of food and millions of food insecure households. Both problems can be solved using our Food for Thought app, as the issue is not a lack of food - it's an inequitable distribution of food.

## Overview

Food For Thought connect businesses with excess edible groceries and food to feed those in need for free, instantly. The app that streamlines the process of food recovery and distribution through sharing, transporting and requesting food services. This helps minimize food waste, fight climate change, and most importantly provides food for those in need.

## Work flow

1. Share Food: Users who have excess food post their details such as - location, time when the food was made, number of people, cuisine type and additional data.

2. Transport Food: Anyone who can transport food, can contribute by delivering food from one location to another.

3. Request Food: NGOs or people who manage orphanages/shelter homes can request for food based on their requirements.
